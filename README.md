# GCMP--Gesture_Control_Media_Player
Software that will recognize human hand gestures and operate the VLC media player based on the hand movements that is, it can increase or decrease the volume, pause or start the video, forward the track etc, without actually touching the keyboard. For this project, we have chosen VLC media player, but it can be extended to any application.
